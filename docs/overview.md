# Overview

ScrollCert vΩ is a protocol-driven evaluation and certification pipeline.

Core idea:
- Claims must be preregistered
- Evaluation is blinded where applicable
- Metrics have thresholds
- A decision function (Φ) promotes or rejects claims
- All outputs are reproducible and auditable

This demo is intentionally small and transparent.
